# Project Title
PREDICTION OF DRUG TYPES BY RUNNING NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM

## Short description
It is a python code which is used to predict the type of DRUG suitable for a patient acorrding to the patients other health parameters like Age, Sex, Cholesterol, Na_to_K, BP. I used Neural Network model, Decision Tree and Logestic Regression to analyze the data and do the Prediction.

## Getting Started
The Following instruction will help you set up and execute on local machine

## Prerequisites
Libraries:
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
Scikit-learn (if needed)
```

## Installing
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip intall matplotlib
```

## Running the Tests
To run the test locate the folder on Jupiter where you clone the repository, open it on Jupiter and run the file

## Breakdown of Tests
Training and test sets of the dataset are separated.
StandardScaler is used to scale features.
Training, testing, and evaluation are done on Neural Network, Decision Tree and Logistic regression models.
Confusion matrices and classification reports are the outcomes.

## Deployment
No instruction on deployment as we have to explore more regarding deployment, for now we will be running the script on our local system
